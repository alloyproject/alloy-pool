<h3>Pool's FAQ</h3>

<div class="panel panel-primary">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>I've been mining for X hours and my pending balance has not changed. Why?</strong></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
            The pending balance will increase only when <strong>the pool finds a block and the block has matured</strong>.
            A matured block means that 60 additional blocks need to be found. You can track this on the "Pool Blocks" page. This means that it can take 3-5 hours after your FIRST share submission to get your first payment.

            The pool validates each share that miners are sending.
            If the pool detects that a miner is sending invalid/bad shares in a short period of time it will <strong>automatically ban them for 10 minutes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What is the cause of the invalid shares? </b>
<p>

                Usually too much overclocking or too low of a difficulty. Try a higher port (5555/7777) or FIXEDDIFF to see if that fixes the issue.  See:  <a target="_blank" href="

        <p>
            A great explanation of the orphaned block concept can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3311/what-are-orphaned-blocks">What are Orphaned Blocks</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is <strong>no reward</strong> for orphaned blocks, it's just an aspect of mining.

            The problem is either your hashrate is too low to make the minimum payment or the problem is using old wallet code. Download the newest version from here: <a target="_blank" href="https://alloyproject.org">Alloy Downloads</a>

            You can solomine this coin using the wallet software, but it will take a LONG time to find a block and you may never find one. Using a pool allows you to get paid on a regular basis.
